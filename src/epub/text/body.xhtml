<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The <i>ChoÃ«phoroe</i>, or <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, is the second
play in the only trilogy preserved to us from the
Athenian stage: <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>ChoÃ«phoroe</i>, <i>Eumenides</i>.
The first gives the murder of Agamemnon by his
wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aigisthos; the
second the vengeance of Orestes, helped by his sister
Electra; the third deals with the ultimate solution of
the problem of Sin and Punishment, the purification
of Orestes from the murder of his mother and the
conversion of the spirits of Punishment from Furies
to Beneficent Beings, from "Erinyes" to "Eumenides."</p>

<p>The vengeance of Orestes was made the subject
of plays by all three tragedians. All the plays are
in their ways masterpieces, and each highly characteristic
of its writer. Euripides realizes and
psychologizes the horror of the story; Sophocles,
apparently from a deliberate adoption of the "Homeric"
tone, suppresses the religious problem and
concentrates on the elements of direct passion. Aeschylus,
as I have said elsewhere, "though steeped
in the glory of the world of legend, would not lightly
accept its judgment upon religious and moral questions,
and above all would not, in that region, play at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
make-believe. He would not elude the horror of
this story by simply not mentioning it, like Homer,
or by pretending that an evil act was a good one,
like Sophocles. He faces the horror; realizes it;
and tries to surmount it on the sweep of a great
wave of religious emotion. The mother-murder,
even if done by a god's command, is a sin; a sin
to be expiated by unfathomable suffering. Yet, since
the god cannot have commanded evil, it is a duty
also. It is a sin that must be committed." The
crucial difference is that the ChoÃ«phoroe is not self-contained,
while the other plays are. They are
concerned with a particular story; it is part of a
trilogy dealing with the great problem which lies at
the centre of Greek religionâHubris, Dike, Soteria
or Crime, Punishment and Deliverance. (I may refer
the reader to my introductions to the Agamemnon
and to Euripides' Electra.)</p>

<p>Thus, though to the Greek student this is perhaps,
of all extant tragedies, the most obscure in detail of
language, to the English reader it is not hard to
understand. The atmosphere indeed is very ancient:
it demands imaginative effort: but the sympathy
goes as we would wish it to go and the story tells
itself. Only two points call for special comment.</p>

<p>The first is the name of the play.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The other
two plays are called <i>Electra</i>, after the chief character:
this is called <i>ChoÃ«pheroe</i>, or <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, after
the Chorus. For in truth the subjects are not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
artistically speaking, quite the same. The main
interest of the other plays is to describe how the
woman Electra felt and acted with regard to the
murder of her mother and step-father; in this play
it is to narrate how Agamemnon, the long dead,
was awakened to help his children to avenge him.
The ghosts in Homer could not speak till they had
drunk the blood of sacrifice. Somewhat in the same
way the dead Agamemnon here cannot gather his
dim senses till the drink-offerings have sunk into his
grave. The wine and milk and honey reach his
parched lips. He stirs in his sleep, and in that one
moment of hesitating consciousness there are crowded
upon him all those appeals that have most power
to rouse and sting. The first words spoken in prayer
at his neglected tomb; the call for vengeance sent,
as it were, unknowingly by the murderess; the
repeated story of his old wrongs and the outrage done
upon his body; above all, the voices of his desolate
children crying to him for that which he himself
craves. There is no visible apparition from the
tomb, as there is, for instance, in the <i>Persae</i>. But
as the great litany grows in intensity of longing, the
dead seem to draw nearer to the living, and conviction
comes to the mourners, one after another, that he
who was once King of Kings is in power among them.
Where in all literature, except Aeschylus, could one
find this union of primitive ghostliness with high
intellectual passion? One hand seems to reach out
to the African or Polynesian, while the other clasps
that of Milton or Goethe.</p>

<p>Another point which the hasty reader might overlook
is the psychological treatment of Orestes. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the end of the play, of course, he goes mad. That is
in the legend. But from quite the early scenesâmuch
of the prologue happens to be lostâthe shadow
of the coming darkness begins to show itself. And
the occasion for it is always the same, the conflict
between two horrors which are also duties: the
murder of his mother on one side, and on the other
disobedience to the command of God.</p>

<p>Here, as in most cases, the development of Greek
tragedy moves almost straight from Aeschylus to
Euripides, with Sophocles standing aside. The character
of Orestes, in particular, contains here in germ
just the ideas that are so subtly developed in Euripides.
The first study is grander, tenderer, and more heroic;
the second, of course, more detailed and varied and
more finely poignant. There is a typical difference
between the two poets in the way in which Orestes'
last scruples are overcome. In Euripides a whole
scene is given up to it. Orestes is shaken by the
first sight of his mother in the distance, and actually
rebels against the god or devil who has commanded
him to kill her, till he is overborne by the scorn and
passion of Electra's more bitter nature. In Aeschylus
Orestes' scruple breaks out in the midst of the Invocation
and is swept away, not specially by Electra,
but by the whole great swelling rhythm of that litany
of revenge.</p>

<p>Of the other characters, Electra in Euripides bears
the main weight of the tragedy on her own shoulders.
In Aeschylus she is much less minutely and without
doubt less cruelly studied: almost all her words are
beautiful, and she keeps a kind of tenderness even in
her prayers of hate. She hates her oppressors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
her father's enemies; but the hate is based on love,
and it has not eaten into her nor left her poisoned.
Clytemnestra, though she appears only for two short
scenes, preserves still the almost superhuman grandeur
which was hers in the <i>Agamemnon</i>. Her simplest
word has power to arrest the attention; and while
she is present other people seem small and their emotions
ordinary. Her own emotions lie deep and complex,
fold behind fold. It is shallow to dismiss her as a
hypocrite, feigning grief at the death of the son whom
she fears. The hypocrisy is there, but so is the
sorrow; so are all kinds of unspoken memories and
hopes and depths of experience. Always the thing
she says, fine as it is, leaves the impression that there
is something greater that she does not care to say.
Even when she calls for the axe of battle to face her
son, she has room for a thought beyond the immediate
fight for dear life: "To that meseemeth we are
come, we two!" That touch is like Euripides, but
on the whole this heroine was a figure not in Euripides'
style and perhaps not within his range. He made a
Clytemnestra deliberately and utterly different.</p>

<p>The date of Sophocles' play is unknown. But the
<i>ChoÃ«phoroe</i> was produced in 458 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and Euripides'
<i>Electra</i> in 413. The forty-five years that separate
them were years of very rapid artistic development.
The <i>ChoÃ«phoroe</i> has both an archaic beauty and a
stark grimness of speech which divide it from its two
companions. There are fewer details, and attention
is never long distracted from the central horror.
At point after point of the action it is easy to show
how the two later poets refined and developed the
plain lines of Aeschylus, and exerted themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
make the story more human and more probable.
The comparison tempts one to reflect how little such
technical improvements really matter, and how
dangerously near to nothingness, in the last resort,
are the ingenuities of realism. This play produces
its illusion quite sufficiently by its mere grandeur and
intensity. Yet, judged on its own archaic level, it
shows remarkable skill in construction, just as, amid
its story of relentless revenge, it conveys a great sense
of compassion. The prologue itself is very skilful.
With the last lines of the <i>Agamemnon</i> still ringing
in our minds we see, as the play opens, a young man
standing with shorn hair beside a grave mound; and
half the story is told in a flash. Nor, apart from the
marvellous invocation scene itself, would it be easy
to find in Greek drama another play with such varied
moments as the prayer of Electra, the entry of the
poor, loving, half-ridiculous Nurse, the sudden onrush
of the single terrified slave calling for help to the
Women's House; above all, the amazing scene at
the end with the blood-stained robe, the gathering of
the unseen Furies, the last struggle of Orestes' reason,
and the flight of the would-be Saviour as one Accursed,
never to rest again. The final words of the Chorus
ask the question which is to be answered, or at least
attempted, in the <i>Eumenides</i>.</p>

mound of earth in a desolate expanse. The time
is afternoon.</i> <span class="smcap">Orestes</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pylades</span> <i>in the garb

<pre>O Warder HermÃªs of the world beneath,
Son of the Father who is Lord of Death;
Saviour, be thou my saviour; Help in War,
Help me! I am returned from lands afar
To claim mine own. And on this headland steep
Of death, I call my Father o'er the deep
To hearken, to give ear.âBehold, I bring
Out of my poverty one little thing,
To adorn thy grave, though who can touch the dead
Or wake from sleep that unuplifted head?
Yet long ago in Phokis, where I lay
With Strophius in the hills, being cast away
In childhood, plundered by mine enemies,
And friendless, save for this man, Pylades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16&nbsp;&nbsp;6-21]</a></span>I sware an oath which should for ever set
In memory those they taught me to forget:
If once I came to manhood, so I sware,
In tresses twain I would divide mine hair,
One tress for Inachos river, by whose grace
I live, and one for mourning at this place.
Which oath I here fulfil.
</pre>

<p class="direct3">[<i>He lays the tress of hair upon the upper part of
the grave mound.</i></p>

<pre><span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">O Herald, lay</span>
Before his sight the gift I bring this day,
Who stood not by to mourn him as he fell,
Nor reached mine arms to bid the dead farewell.

<p class="direct3">[<i>As he turns, he sees the Libation-Bearers
approaching.</i></p>

<pre>Ha!
What sight is this? What stricken multitude
Of women here in raiment sable-hued
Far-gleameth? How shall I interpret it?
Hath some new death upon my lineage lit?
Or is it to my father's grave they go
With offerings, to appease the wrath below?
It must be. Surely 'tis Electra there,
My sister, moves alone, none like to her
In sorrow. Zeus, Oh, grant to me this day
My vengeance, and be near me in the fray!
Come, Pylades, stand further, till we know
More sure, what means this embassy of woe.

With offerings to the dead? What word of love,
What prayer to reach my father from above?
"To dear Lord," shall I say, "due gifts I bear
From loving mistress" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when they come from her?
I dare not. And I cannot find the word

Requital due .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for murder and for pride?
Or, as in silence and in shame he died,
In shame and silence shall I pour this urn
Of offering to the dust, and pouring turn,
As men cast out some foulness they abhor,
And fling the cup, and fly, and look no more?

Full unforbidden from these starvÃ¨d eyes,
Gazing upon this hair. 'Tis past belief

Or kindness for her child.âAnd yet to swear
Outright that this glad laugher is the hair
Of my beloved Orestes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I am weak
With dreaming! Had it but a voice to speak
Like some kind messenger, I had not been
This phantom tossing in the wind between
Two fancies. Either quick it would proclaim
Its hate, if from some hater's head it came;
Or, if it were our own, with me 'twould shed
Tears for this tomb and our great father dead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Surely they know, these gods to whom we pray,
Through what wild seas our vessel beats her way,
And, if to save us is their will, may breed
A mighty oak-trunk from a little seed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

And starved with famine, still too weak of wing
To bear to the nest their father's harvesting?
Even so am I, O Zeus, and even so
This woman, both disfathered long ago,
Both to one exile cast, both desolate.
He was thy worshipper, thy giver great
Of sacrifice. If thou tear down his nest,
What hand like his shall glorify thy feast?
Blot out the eagle's brood, and where again
Hast thou thy messenger to speak to men?
Blast this most royal oak, what shade shall cool
Thine altars on the death-day of the Bull?
But cherish us, and from a little seed
Thou shalt make great a House now fallen indeed.

<pre>Oh, Loxias shall not mock my great desire,
Who spoke his divine promise, charging me
To thread this peril to the extremity:
Yea, raised his awful voice and surging told
To my hot heart of horrors stormy-cold
Till I seek out those murderers, by the road
Themselves have shownâso spake heâblood for blood,
In gold-rejecting rage, the wild bull's way!
If not, for their offending I must pay
With mine own life, in torment manifold.
Of many things that rise from earth he told,
To appease the angry dead: yea, and strange forms,
On thee and me, of savage-fangÃ¨d worms,
Climbing the flesh; lichens, which eat away
Even unto nothingness our natural clay.
And when they leave him, a man's hair is white.
For him that disobeys, he said, the night
Hath Furies, shapen of his father's blood;
Clear-seen, with eyeball straining through the hood
Of darkness. The blind arrows of dead men
Who cried their kin for mercy and were slain,
And madness, and wild fear out of the night,
Shall spur him, rack him, till from all men's sight
Alone he goes, out to the desert dim,
And that bronze horror clanging after him!
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For such as he there is no mixing bowl,</span>
No dear libation that binds soul to soul:
From every altar fire the unseen rage
Outbars him: none shall give him harbourage,

He crawls to his death, a carcase to the core
Through-rotted, and embalmed to suffer more.

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spake he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God, and is one to believe</span>
Such oracles as these? Nay, though I give
No credence, the deed now must needs be done.
So many things of power work here as one:
The God's command; grief for my father slain;
And mine own beggary urgeth me amain,
That never shall these Argives, famed afar,
High conquerors of Troy in joyous war
Cower to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two women. For he bears, I know,
A woman's heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If not, this day will show.

Wore the same swathing-bands these limbs had worn,
Fanged the same breast that suckled me of yore,
And through the sweet milk drew that gout of gore;
And seeing she understood, and sore afeared
Shrieked: therefore it must be that, having reared
A birth most ghastly, she in wrath shall die:
And I, the beast, the serpent, even I
Shall slay her! Be it so. The dream speaks clear.

Our tongues an accent of Parnassian speech,
Like men in PhÃ´kis born. And say, perchance
None of the warders with glad countenance
Will ope to us, the House being so beset
With evil: aye, what then? Then obdurate
We shall wait on, till all who pass that way
Shall make surmise against the House, and say
"What ails Aigisthos? Wherefore doth he close
His door against the traveller, if he knows
And is within?" So comes it, soon or late,
I cross the threshold of the courtyard gate;
And entering find him on my father's throne.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Or, say he is abroad and comes anon,
And hears, and calls for meâand there am I
Before him, face to face and eye to eye;
"Whence comes the traveller?" ere he speaks it, dead
I lay him, huddled round this leaping blade!
Then shall the Curse have drunken of our gore
Her third, last, burning cup, and thirst no more.

And ope to me the strait way of the sword.

Takes thee to Argos, prithee find me there

Is best remembered: tell them he is dead.
Forget not. And howe'er their choice may run,

Discover, and bring back to me their will.
Tell them his ashes lie with me, inurned

<pre>The mistress bids me call Aigisthos here
Quickly, to see these two, and learn more clear,
As man from man, the truth of what they tell.
Oh, to us slaves she makes it pitiable
And grievous, and keeps hid behind her eyes
The leaping laughter. Aye, 'tis a rich prize
For her, and for the House stark misery,
This news the travellers tell so trippingly.
And, Oh, Aigisthos, he, you may be sure,
Will laugh to hear it! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, I am a poor
Old woman! Such a tangle as they were,
The troubles in this House, and hard to bear,
Long years back, and all aching in my breast!
But none that hurt like this! Through all the rest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Well, I was sore, but lived them down and smiled.
But little Orestes, my heart's care, the child
I took straight from his mother; and save me
He had no other nurse! And, Oh, but he
Could scream and order me to tramp the dark!
Aye, times enough, and trouble enough, and stark
Wasted at that! A small thing at the breast,
That has no sense, you tend it like a beast,
By guesswork. For he never speaks, not he,
A babe in swaddling clothes, if thirst maybe
Or hunger comes, or any natural need.
The little belly takes its way. Indeed,
'Twas oft a prophet he wanted, not a nurse;
And often enough my prophecies, of course,
Came late, and then 'twas clothes to wash and dry,
And fuller's work as much as nurse's. Aye,
I followed both trades, from the day when first

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p>The beginning of this play is lost, through an injury
to the single MS on which it depends. The MS
only begins at "Ha, what sight is this?" which is
conventionally numbered l. 10, though probably there
were at least twenty or thirty lines preceding it.
Curiously enough, three passages from the missing
part are quoted by different ancient authors, so that
a good deal of it can be supplied.</p>

<p>P. 15, l. 2, The meaning of this phrase was obscure
even to Aeschylus' contemporaries, and is discussed
in Aristophanes' <i>Frogs</i> 1126 ff. It seems to mean
that HermÃªs Psychopompos (Guide of the Dead) is
son of Zeus Chthonios (Zeus of the Underworld).
"Saviour" and "Help in War" are other titles of
HermÃªs.</p>

<p>P. 16, l. 6, Ãnachos: The river of Argos. So
Achilles on reaching manhood cut off his long hair
as a gift to the River Spercheios. Rivers in a land
subject to drought were worshipped as "life-giving"
or "rearers of young men" (<ins class="greek" title="kourotrophoi">ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Î¹</ins>).</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 22, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>: The Chorus are slave
women taken in war. We know no more of them.
They certainly do not seem to be Trojans, and, like
the Nurse later, they have the feelings of loyal old
retainers towards the House, hating Aigisthos and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
loving the memory of Agamemnon. Throughout the
play Aigisthos is represented as a usurper and a tyrant,
holding his rule by fear. Cf. (ll. 885 ff., 935 ff.)
the exultant tone of the two last choruses.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 32, "Dread, very dread": Clytemnestra
had a dangerous dream. If she had gone at once to
a skilled interpreter, he might possibly have given it
a favourable interpretation and thus partly averted the
consequences. Instead of this she shrieked in terror.
That shriek was itself an interpretation which could
never be explained away. The prophets, when consulted,
explained that the dream came from the anger
of Agamemnon, and Clytemnestra then made the
fatal mistake of sending offerings to his grave to appease
his wrath. This was far too slight a thing to appease
him; but it did awake him, and so enabled him to
help his avengers.</p>

<p>P. 18, l. 61, "Who knows the great Wheel's swing,"
etc.: A difficult passage. It seems to mean that
justice (i.e. both retribution to the sinner and reparation
to the sinned-against) sometimes comes quick
and clear; sometimes is long delayed, and sometimes
is wrapt in night, i.e. no one can say for certain whether
it comes at all.</p>

<p>P. 19, l. 84, Electra feels that it is a mockery, and
perhaps an impiety, to pour the peace-offerings of
the murderess. The Leader urges her not to hesitate,
but deliberately to use the offerings as an appeal for
vengeance. The thought at first appals her, but she
nerves herself to it. In her prayer she deliberately
tells her father the things that will most sting him
into wakefulness. The passage "I lay these tokens
down," seems to mean that she puts upon the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
stones or some other objects to act as a perpetual
reminder and keep her prayer alive.</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 151, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>: "Let fall the tear," etc.:
The grave is a barrier-stone between the dead and
the living, a "turner-back of Evil as of Good";
yet not absolutely so. The prayers of his children,
and the tears of their suffering, may after all get past
the barriers and reach the "darkened heart" of the
dead. This idea is in the essence of the play.</p>

<p>P. 23, ll. 165-210, Recognition scene. It was a
traditional story that Electra had recognized Orestes
by a lock of hair, a footprint, and a bit of weaving.
Aristophanes (<i>Clouds</i>, 534 ff.) speaks of his comedy,
"like Electra of old, recognizing its brother's tress"
when it meets a spectator of true Attic taste. It
would be a mistake to apply realist canons to this
ancient tale. Among barefooted peoples family likenesses
are apt to be chiefly traced in the feet and
hair. Both Arab and Australian "trackers" are cited
to this effect, as also is the Odyssey (iv. 148 ff., xix.
358, 381). See Tucker's <i>ChoÃ«phoroe</i>, p. lxvi. It is
interesting to note that Sophocles in his <i>Electra</i> omits
the traditional signs altogether. Euripides uses them,
but uses them in a completely original way to illustrate
Electra's state of mind. An old peasant tries to show
the "signs" to her. She longs to believe that Orestes
has come, but in fear of disappointment refuses to look
at them and rejects every suggestion of comfort. See
my version and note there. (P. 31 ff., ll. 508-548.)</p>

<p>P. 25, l. 211, "Torment of heart and blinding of
the brain": Electra bows down and buries her face
in her hands. When she next looks up, there is an
armed man like her father standing just above her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
father's tomb. Note that she begins by refusing to
believe. A motive which is afterwards deepened
and elaborated by Euripides has been suggested by
Aeschylus. See above.</p>

<p>P. 29, ll. 269 ff., "Oh, Loxias shall not mock,"
etc.: Orestes at the end of the play goes mad; before
that certain of his speeches are strangely violent and
incoherent. Scholars have generally supposed the text
to be exceptionally corrupt, but I think it will be
found that this particular tone of incoherence never
comes except when there is a mention of Delphi and
Apollo's command. I think, therefore, that the
wildness of these speeches is intentional, and the
madness of the end does not come unprepared. It
will be noticed in the last scene with what psychological
daring as well as subtlety Aeschylus depicts the final
collapse of his hero's reason.</p>

<p>P. 29, l. 275, "The wild bull's way": Ought
Orestes to accept a money payment to atone for his
father's slaying, or, like a wild bull driven out from
the herd, should he accept no peace but insist on a
life for a life? The commutation of the blood-feud
for a money payment was, of course, a softening of
primitive manners. As such, it is elaborately provided
for in various codes of early law. Yet, while
it marks a social advance, at the same time it often
involves a softening and weakening of the sense of
duty in the individual. Orestes could probably have
lived in comfort if he had been willing to accept
a large blood-price from Aigisthos and say no more
about it. He prefers, with all its misery and danger,
the absolute fulfilment of his duty to his father. To
us, and in this special case to Aeschylus, the rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
vengeance seems savage. We speak glibly of the
"duty of forgiveness." But it should be remembered
that we expect the police to arrest the offender and
the judge to see that he is hanged. In Orestes' days
men had to do justice on the wicked with their own
hands, or else leave them unpunished and triumphant.</p>

<p>P. 29, l. 290, "That bronze horror": The
meaning is not known. It may be some instrument
of torture, but more likely it is something intended
to make a noise, like the bell sometimes worn by
lepers in the Middle Ages, to warn people of the
presence of the Accursed One.</p>

<p>P. 30, ll. 315-510, The Invocation. This extraordinary
scene is really the heart of the play and
gives to the <i>ChoÃ«phoroe</i> a strange supernatural atmosphere
which is absent from both the <i>Electra</i> plays.
There is no invocation scene in Sophocles; there is
a brief one in Euripides (<i>Electra</i> 671-685). It has
great emotional effect but is only about 15 lines long
and does not attempt to produce the cumulative impression
of this scene, in which we feel human suffering
and love gradually breaking through the barriers of
death and earth and darkness. At the end the dead
Agamemnon is awake, and Orestes hardly needs to
think about the details of his dangerous plot. A
power more than mortal is behind him. It will be
noticed how the scene works up, like certain religious
litanies, to a pitch of more and more overpowering
and almost hysterical emotion: then, in the regular
Greek manner, it descends again to something like
calm.</p>

<p>P. 33, l. 380, "Ah me, that word, that word":
The thought that he himself hates his mother is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
what pierces Orestes' heart. In his next speech also
he is bewildered. Not till l. 434, "All, all dishonour,"
does he lose all scruple in the storm of his passion.</p>

<p>P. 35, ll. 428-442, "Ho, Mother; ho, thou,
Mother, mine enemy!" First Electra tells of the
shameful secret burial: this rouses Orestes to fury.
Then the Leader tells of something worse. The
murderess had mutilated the body; cut off the dead
man's feet so that he could not pursue, and his hands
so that he could not lay hold of her. This would
make Agamemnon helpless, and so leave Orestes
without hope. The unexpected abomination breaks
Orestes down.âThis device of terrified murderers
is a piece of primitive magic. It is attributed to
Clytemnestra by Sophocles (<i>Electra</i> 445), and to the
witch Medea by Apollonius Rhodius.</p>

<p>P. 38, l. 471, "The House hath healing," i.e. the
House itself can cure bloodshed by bloodshed, sin by
vengeance.</p>

<p>P. 40, l. 510, "Behold, ye have made a long and
yearning praise": The dead must surely now be
satisfied. Even if neglected for years he has now
had such a lamentation as requites him for all.</p>

<p>P. 40, l. 515, "What power the Daemon hath
which guardeth thee": The word Daemon has no
connotation of evil in classical Greek.</p>

<p>P. 41, l. 517, "One dead and feeling not!":
Not strictly consistent perhaps with the invocation
scene, but psychologically right. The dead are past
feeling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless something very extraordinary is
done to make them feel. Then, who knows?</p>

<p>P. 41, l. 527, Clytemnestra's dream that she gave
birth to a serpent is traditional. It is found both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
before Aeschylus and after. The asps of Libya and
divers other serpent things were "matricides"; at
birth they tore and killed their mother. See <i>Herodotus</i>
3, 109; Euripides' <i>Orestes</i> 479.</p>

<p>P. 43, l. 563, "An accent of Parnassian speech":
It is interesting to note that there is no trace of Phocian
dialect in Orestes' actual language later on. To make
him talk broad Phocian would, according to convention,
have made him "comic," like certain Boeotians,
Spartans, and Scythians in Aristophanes. On
the other hand, an oriental colour is often allowed in
tragic language, especially in lyric passages, e.g. in
Aeschylus' <i>Persae</i>.</p>

<p>P. 43, l. 574, The reading is doubtful. I read <ins class="greek" title="m' hoi">Î¼' Î¿á¼±</ins>
for <ins class="greek" title="moi">Î¼Î¿Î¹</ins>
and <ins class="greek" title="kalein">ÎºÎ±Î»Îµá¿Î½</ins>
for <ins class="greek" title="balein">Î²Î±Î»Îµá¿Î½</ins>.</p>

<p>P. 44, l. 583, "One Below": i.e. Agamemnon.</p>

<p>P. 44, l. 585, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>: The sense of this chorus
is often difficult and the text apparently corrupt,
especially the end. "There are many terrible things,
but none so terrible as a woman's passion; for instance
(602), Althaea, daughter of Thestios, who
slew her son MeleÃ¢ger; or (612) Skylla of Megara
who betrayed her father NÃ®sos; or (631) the Lemnian
women, who slew their husbands; and, after all
(623âa stanza has been transposed) have we not an
example here in Clytemnestra?"</p>

<p>Althaea: See Swinburne's <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>.
When her son MeleÃ¢ger was born she saw in the
room the three Fates, one of whom foretold that
MeleÃ¢ger should die when a red brand then burning
in the fire was consumed. Althaea leapt out of bed
and saved the brand. Afterwards, when MeleÃ¢ger
fell in love with Atalanta, and in a feud on her behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
killed his mother's two brethren, she threw the brand
into the fire.</p>

<p>Skylla: Skylla, daughter of NÃ®sos, King of Megara,
whose life depended on a magic lock of hair. She
fell in love with Minos, who was besieging Megara,
and betrayed her father to him. The rings of Cretan
gold were apparently a love-gift.</p>

<p>Lemnos: The native women of Lemnos in one
night rose and killed their Greek husbands, perhaps
because the men had left them for Thracian concubines,
perhaps for other reasons. See <i>Rise of the
Greek Epic</i>, Ed. 2, p. 77.</p>

<p>P. 47, l. 652, The time is now evening and the
scene is in front of the castle of the Atreidae. In
Aeschylus' time there was probably no actual change
made in the stage arrangements. The back wall
represented a palace front, while in the centre of the
orchestra was an altar or mound which stood for
Agamemnon's tomb. In the first half of the play
you attended to the tomb and ignored the back scene:
in the second you attended to the castle and ignored
the mound.</p>

<p>Observe the delay before the door is opened. This
increases the dramatic tension and at the same time
makes us feel that the House is "beset with evil."
An ordinary great house would be thrown open at
the first knock.</p>

<p>P. 48, l. 668, The first entrance of Clytemnestra,
about whom we have thought and talked so much,
is immensely important. She comes unexpected,
standing suddenly in the great doorway where we
last saw her, with blood on her brow and an axe
in her hands, standing over the dead bodies (<i>Agamemnon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
1372). Before that we had seen her in the same
position, hardly less sinister, calling Cassandra to her
death: "Thou, likewise, come within." (<i>Agamemnon</i>
1035.)</p>

<p>The first entrances of Clytemnestra in the two
<i>Electra</i> plays are also striking. In Sophocles (<i>Electra</i>
516) she bursts in upon Electra, like a termagant,
in a sudden agony of rage. In Euripides (<i>Electra</i>
998 ff.), when we have been led to expect a savage
murderess, we meet "a sad, middle-aged woman
whose first words are an apology, controlling quickly
her old fires, anxious to be as little hated as possible."</p>

<p>P. 48, l. 674. There is an almost reckless fluency
about Orestes' speech. In his bitterness he treats
the news of his death as a trifle, not showing, nor
expecting from others, any particular emotion about
it. As a matter of fact, it gives Clytemnestra a greater
shock than he expected. There is no reason to doubt
the general sincerity of her words. Of course, she
feared Orestes and knew he was her enemy. When
it comes to a fight she is ready. At the same time,
she has, as shown in the last scenes of the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
an aching sense of disaster and friendlessness, and
would like to think that, when all the rest of the
House had gone under, the son she had sent away was
living somewhere unhurt, and might perhaps be
grateful to her. As it is, her old enemy, the Curse
of the House, has beaten her.</p>

<p>P. 51, ll. 731-782. This poignant and vivid
scene of the old nurse, ludicrous in her tears, is a
striking departure from the stately conventions of
Greek tragedy. Neither Sophocles nor Euripides has
left any scene like it. Herakles in the <i>Alcestis</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
pro-Satyric. The panic-stricken Phrygian slave in
the <i>Orestes</i> (<i>Orestes</i> 1369-1530) is grotesque, but
grotesquely horrible. In actual language the nurse's
diction is on the whole tragic in colour and her metre
correct: the grammar is rather loose and exclamatory.
The name "Kilissa" (Cilician woman) suggests a
slave.</p>

<p>P. 53, ll. 783-837. Again the sense is difficult
and the text extremely uncertain. The chorus pray
in the name of their innocence and Agamemnon's
long service to Zeus for pity; to the Gods of the
Possessions of the House (Latin "penates," sometimes
grouped together as Zeus KtÃªsios) to help in the
cleansing and rebuilding of the House (l. 800); to
Apollo of the Cavern of Delphi, the God of Light,
to help the House to light out of darkness (l. 812);
to HermÃªs, the God of craft and secrecy, to help in
a plot for the right (l. 819). The battle will be a
battle of liberation from tyrants.</p>

<p>P. 56, l. 827. Orestes should think of his duty
to his father and forget all else. As Perseus when
killing the Gorgon turned his eyes away lest her
face should freeze him to stone, so let Orestes, when
he meets his mother, veil his eyes and smite.</p>

<p>P. 56, l. 838, <span class="smcap">Aigisthos</span>: Just as they mention
"him who sowed the seed of wrong," he enters.
In a short but vivid scene we may perhaps see the
man's harshness and confidence, but the truth is
that in Aeschylus we are told almost nothing about
Aigisthos except that Clytemnestra loved him.</p>

<p>P. 57, ll. 855-874. The usual rather low-toned,
prayerlike song broken in upon by the death-cry.
(Cf. <i>Agamemnon</i> 1342, Euripides' <i>Electra</i> 1163, etc.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
The Chorus naturally shrink away from the house
in order not to be involved in imminent danger.
This also has the advantage that it leaves the scene
empty, and the slave who rushes out in terror crying
for help finds no one. I receive the impression that
the scene is meant to be dark, which would imply
that at the end of the play Orestes stood between men
holding torches. There is wonderful power in this
scene. There are no men to help; no women even;
all the world is dumb and asleep. Then suddenly
there is Clytemnestra.</p>

<p>P. 59, l. 886, "The dead are risen": A deliberately
riddling line, in the Greek meaning either:
"I tell thee the dead are slaying the living man," or
"I tell thee the living man is slaying the dead."</p>

<p>P. 59, l. 893, "Aigisthos, my beloved": Up to
this moment she has been ready to fight. The death
of her beloved unstrings her. One would like to
know whether Aeschylus meant her actually to have
the axe and drop it, or whether Orestes is intended to
come too soon. Note with what intensity even when
the fight has gone out of her she fences for her life.
Every line of the scene is charged with meaning and
feeling. The thing that breaks her is the sudden
realization (928) that this is the serpent of her dream.
An interesting piece of technique which I have not
tried to represent is here found in the original.
Orestes' words in 927 are so arranged as to produce
almost exactly the word "hisses" (<ins class="greek" title="sourizei">ÏÎ¿á½Ïá½·Î¶ÎµÎ¹</ins>
for <ins class="greek" title="soi horizei">ÏÎ¿Î¹ á½Ïá½·Î¶ÎµÎ¹</ins>
= <ins class="greek" title="syrizei">ÏÏÏá½·Î¶ÎµÎ¹</ins>).</p>

<p>P. 61, ll. 920, "A woman starves": This is
her first argument in <i>Agamemnon</i> 862 ff.: "That
any woman thus should sit alone," etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 62, ll. 935-972 <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>: A short song of
exultation. Justice has come both to Troy and to
Argos. HermÃªs, the God of Guile, has done it, but
Justice held his hand and he only did her will. We
have had several times already the scruples of Orestes'
conscience, but this is the first doubt expressed by the
Chorus as to the righteousness of the mother-murder.
"Is the power of God hemmed in so strangely to
work with wrong?" All doubts, however, are
swallowed up in joy at the liberation of Argos and
the downfall of the tyrants.</p>

<p>P. 65, l. 973-end. This marvellous scene scarcely
needs comment. The showing of the robe in which
Agamemnon was slain is, perhaps, imitated in the
Forum Scene of <i>Julius Caesar</i>, which came to
Shakespeare direct from Plutarch's Lives (<i>Brutus</i>
ch. 20, <i>Anthony</i> ch. 14). But the main interest here
is in something quite different. The madness of which
we have seen the approaching shadow now closes in
upon Orestes. The first definite sign of it comes at
l. 996, where, as Conington followed by Dr. Verrall
pointed out, he tries to find a name to describe his
mother. As he gropes for the word, the great
crimson robe with the stains of blood obsesses his
mind and he calls her "a winding-sheet, a snare,
a net," and so on. (So Cassandra in <i>Agamemnon</i> 114
calls her "a net and a snare.") We may notice that
"dead without a child" (1006) is a more awful
curse in Greek than in English. He appears at this
point to sink into speechlessness, only to rouse himself
more fiercely at l. 1010: "Did she the deed or
no?" The few low-toned lines of music by the
Chorus add a great beauty to the scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 67, l. 1043. Orestes' last sentence is unfinished;
as he was evidently going to leave behind him some
word of bad omen, the Leader of the Chorus interrupts
with words of comfort. As she mentions the "two
serpents' heads" (1048) there is a cry of horror,
and the "armed slayer" is seen appealing to the
slave women to protect him. He has seen the shapes
with snaky hair beginning to crowd upon him. The
last touch of tragedy is in 1061 when he realizes that
he is alone in his suffering ("You cannot see them;
I alone can see") and knows that he "shall never
rest again."</p>

<p>P. 69, ll. 1065-1076. The last chorus states with
a clarity unusual in Aeschylus and more characteristic
of Euripides, the exact problem of the Trilogy. First
came the sin of Atreus against the children of Thyestesâthough
that too was an act of revenge; second,
the punishment of that by Thyestes' son Aigisthos
when he and Clytemnestra murdered Agamemnon;
thirdly, the punishment of that second crime at
Apollo's bidding by Orestes. Is Orestes the Third
Saviour, or is his act only another link in the interminable
chain of crime? If the Curse is now brought
to sleep, is that because the House is really purified
or because there is nothing left for the Curse to work
upon? For the "Third Saviour," see my <i>Four
Stages of Greek Religion</i>, p. 46 ff. "First comes this
year with its pride and its pollution, then the winter
that kills it, then the clean spring. First comes the
crime, then the punishment, which is only another
crime, then perhaps the redemption." Whether
Orestes is a saviour or a final caster-down of the
race is determined in the next play, the <i>Eumenides</i>.</p>

<p class="small1">Meister Johann Dietz was a barber's surgeon who flourished in the
latter part of the seventeenth century and lived to see the accession of
Frederick the Great. Not only did Master Dietz go through many a
hard-fought campaign, he was for some time surgeon aboard a whaler,
and his description of Arctic adventures in the seventeenth century is no
less absorbing than his tales of war. Nor does the worthy barber forget
to chronicle his domestic misfortunes, and we owe to his candid simplicity
a remarkable picture of middle-class life on the Continent during one of
the most turbulent periods of history.<br>
<br>
The volume is illustrated by miniature reproductions of many steel and
copper-plate engravings illustrating battles, sieges, cities and fortifications.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Transcriber's Notes</b></p>

<p>The line numbers refer to the lines in the original Greek text, not
the lines as translated.</p>

<p>In the "invocation" section (lines 315-510 starting on
<a href="#Page_30" class="indexlink">Pg 30</a>), the numbering of the
Antistrophe stanzas is not out of sequence, as it may appear. Each
correctly responds to the rhythm of its equivalent Strophe, although
not spoken in the same order.</p>

<p>The use of an em-dash before a line of speech indicates that a different
individual of the Chorus is speaking each line in the stanza.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation omissions corrected.</p>
